        <h2><strong>The Dark Knight</strong></h2>
        <img src="./The_Dark_Knight_(2008_film).jpg" alt="The Dark Knight">
        <p>"The Dark Knight" is a 2008 American superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan. It is the second
            installment in Nolan's Batman trilogy, following "Batman Begins" (2005). The
            film centers around Batman (played by Christian Bale) as he faces a new, terrifying foe: the Joker (played
            by Heath Ledger).
            Plot: The movie is set in Gotham City, where crime has decreased thanks to Batman's efforts and the work of
            District Attorney Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart). However, a
            chaotic and psychopathic criminal known as the Joker emerges, threatening to unleash total anarchy in the
            city. He begins a series of brutal attacks, challenging Batman,
            Gotham City's police, and Harvey Dent to stop him.

            The Joker terrorizes the city by manipulating people and turning them against each other, forcing Batman to
            confront the limits of his own morality and sense of justice. The
            film delves into themes like chaos vs. order, good vs. evil, and the personal sacrifices required to fight
            against evil.

            The Joker's schemes lead to tragic consequences, especially for Harvey Dent, who undergoes a transformation
            into the vengeful and disillusioned villain Two-Face. The film
            concludes with Batman taking the blame for Dent's actions to preserve his image as a hero in the eyes of the
            public, making him a fugitive.

            Themes and Reception: "The Dark Knight" was praised for its dark and complex narrative, Nolan's direction,
            and Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker. Ledger
            posthumously won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. The film is widely regarded as one
            of the greatest superhero movies of all time and has had a
            significant impact on the genre.</p>

            History: Greece is often referred to as the cradle of Western civilization. It is the birthplace of
            democracy, Western philosophy, and the Olympic Games. The ancient Greeks made significant contributions to
            art, architecture, science, and literature. Famous historical sites include the Acropolis in Athens, the
            ruins of Delphi, and the ancient city of Olympia.

            Cuisine: Greek food is known for its use of fresh ingredients like olive oil, vegetables, herbs, and
            seafood. Popular dishes include moussaka (a baked dish with layers of eggplant, minced meat, and b√©chamel
            sauce), souvlaki (grilled meat skewers), and spanakopita (spinach and feta cheese pie). Greek salads, often
            featuring tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, and feta cheese, are also a staple.

            Beautiful Cities: Greece is home to many picturesque cities and islands. Athens, the capital, is famous for
            its ancient monuments and vibrant culture. Thessaloniki, the second-largest city, is known for its rich
            history and lively festivals. The islands of Santorini and Mykonos are world-renowned for their stunning
            landscapes, whitewashed buildings, and crystal-clear waters.

            Culture: Greek culture is characterized by its strong traditions in music, dance, and religious festivals.
            The Greek Orthodox Church plays a significant role in daily life. Traditional Greek music often features
            instruments like the bouzouki, and dances like the sirtaki are performed at celebrations.

            and warm Mediterranean climate. Popular tourist spots include the ancient ruins in Athens, the monasteries
